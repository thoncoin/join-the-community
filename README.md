# DEFINITION

The word "hackathon" is a portmanteau of the words "hack" and "marathon".

The term hack refers to any work-around solution.

The word marathon refers to a long-distance race, completed by running, walking , or a run/walk strategy.

The word Thon come from hack-a-thon

# ORIGIN
OpenBSD's apparent first use of the term referred to a cryptographic development event held in Calgary on June 4, 1999, where ten developers came together to avoid legal problems caused by export regulations of cryptographic software from the United States. Since then, a further three-to-five events per year have occurred around the world to advance development, generally on university campuses.

For Sun Microsystems(now Oracle), the usage referred to an event at the JavaOne conference from June 15 to June 19, 1999; there John Gage challenged attendees to write a program in Java for the new Palm V using the infrared port to communicate with other Palm users and register it on the Internet
